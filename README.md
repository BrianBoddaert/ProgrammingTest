The only thing altered about the car is the adding of the fuel component as a UPROPERTY so that its variables can be altered in the details panel.

I also added a check if the fuel component is out of fuel so the car stops moving.

As the car loses fuel, the fuel component becomes more red and scaled down on the Z-Axis.
When the car is low on fuel a flickering yellow icon should show up.
When the car is really low on fuel it turns red and flickers faster.

The car is not dependent on the component.
